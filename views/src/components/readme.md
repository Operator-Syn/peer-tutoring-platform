# 🗂 React Component

Purpose
- Provide a consistent structure and conventions for React components in this app.
- Make components easy to find, reuse, test, and maintain.

Folder & file layout (per-component)
- Prefer one folder per component:
  ComponentName/
    - ComponentName.jsx
    - ComponentName.css

Component style
- Use functional components with hooks.
- Keep components small: single responsibility.
- Split presentational (UI) vs container (data/logic) when helpful.
