Components Folder
-----------------

This folder contains reusable React components.

What goes here:
- UI building blocks (buttons, cards, modals, etc.)
- Page sections (headers, footers, navigation bars)
- Any self-contained piece of UI logic

What does NOT go here:
- Pages or views (place those in a "pages" folder if you use one)
- Global state, hooks, or utilities (better suited for a "hooks" or "utils" folder)
- Static assets (keep those in "assets")

Notes:
- Each component should ideally be its own file.
- Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., "Button.jsx", not "btn.jsx").
- Group related files if needed (e.g., component + styles).
- Keep components reusable and modular whenever possible.
