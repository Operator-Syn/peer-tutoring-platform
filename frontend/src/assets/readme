Assets Folder
-------------

This folder contains static resources used by the application.
These files are typically imported into React components or referenced in styles.

What goes here:
- Images (logos, icons, backgrounds)
- Illustrations (SVGs, diagrams)
- Media (audio, video)
- Other static resources that are imported in code

What does NOT go here:
- Files that should be served directly without processing (put those in the "public" folder instead)
- Large assets that don’t need to be hashed by Vite

Notes:
- Files in this folder are processed by Vite’s build system (optimized and hashed).
- Keep only assets that are imported or referenced in your code.
- Use the "public" folder for globally available raw files (e.g., robots.txt, favicon.ico).
